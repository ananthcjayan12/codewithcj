   - [ ] Improve error feedback
   - [ ] Add optimistic updates

3. Testing:

   - [ ] Add UI component tests
   - [ ] Add integration tests

## Implementation Notes

1. Authentication:

   - Use route handler client for public reads
   - Verify both API key and Bearer token

2. Error Handling:
   - Add specific error messages
   - Add proper status codes
   - Add client-side error feedback

3. Data Validation:
   - Add request body validation
   - Add response validation
   - Add type checking

4. Performance:
   - Add proper caching
   - Add optimistic updates
   - Add loading states
